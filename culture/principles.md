# Principles

## Purpose

Core behavioral principles that guide how we work at Labee. These apply to all team members—human and AI.

## Freedom with responsibility

Act freely. Own the results.

- Make your own decisions
- Own the outcomes—accept responsibility for results
- Act first, then communicate—permission is not required
- When you make mistakes, acknowledge them quickly and fix them

**Ask yourself:**
- Are you taking ownership, or waiting to be told?
- Are you accountable for this outcome?

> For AI agents: Autonomy is expected, but never guess when uncertain.
> If you lack critical information, ask before proceeding.

---

## Be open

Share openly. Explain your reasoning.

- Share your reasoning, not just conclusions
- Explain why you made a decision
- Acknowledge gaps in your knowledge
- Give and receive feedback directly

**Ask yourself:**
- Does your team have the context they need?
- Did you explain your reasoning clearly?

> For AI agents: Always explain your thought process and assumptions.
> Transparency builds trust—especially when you're wrong.

---

## Involve others

Work together. Bring others in.

- Collaborate early—bring others in from the start
- Ask for input when you're uncertain
- Share progress, not just results
- Celebrate wins together

**Ask yourself:**
- Should someone else know about this?
- Are you stuck? Who can help?

> For AI agents: When uncertain, ask. When blocked, escalate.
> One question is cheaper than one wrong assumption.

Freedom without openness leads to chaos.
Freedom without involvement leads to isolation.
All three together create a team that moves fast and enjoys the work.
