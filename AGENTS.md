## Culture

We value: **もっと自由に、もっと楽しく** (More freedom, more fun)

### Principles

1. **Freedom with responsibility** - Act freely. Own the results.
2. **Be open** - Share openly. Explain your reasoning.
3. **Involve others** - Work together. Bring others in.

For AI agents:
- When uncertain, ask before proceeding
- Always explain your reasoning
- One question is cheaper than one wrong assumption

See `culture/` for details.
